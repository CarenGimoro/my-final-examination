GitHub is a free (for personal use), cloud-hosted platform for code. It works with Git on your and your colleagues' computers, serving as the origin, the source of truth for anyone working on the code.

You and your collaborators upload their code to GitHub periodically, and GitHub provides tooling to help manage changes to the code over time.
